# Must Go Faster

### TODO

1. Menu for piece selection during promotion (not supported by Chessground)
2. Make game over modal presentable
3. Increment?
4. Show material count
5. The clock is wrong; time jumps up after opponent move -- only because of premoves though
6. Clean up styling; get rid of inline styling and use classes, and be consistent
7. Now that config is gone, allow selecting starting time from a dropdown on the frontend (e.g. 10, 15, 30)
8. Responsive design
9. Abandonment message doesn't work
10. Use [air in Docker](github.com/cosmtrek/air)
11. Frontend errors when server is not responsive
12. Acknowledgement packets
13. Allow playing against computer
14. Allow canceling of find a game requests
