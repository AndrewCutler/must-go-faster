# Must Go Faster

## How to run

1. `cd` into root directory
2. `docker compose up`

### TODO

1. Menu for piece selection during promotion (not supported by Chessground)
2. Make game over modal presentable
3. Increment?
4. Show material count
5. The clock is wrong; time jumps up after opponent move -- only because of premoves though
6. Clean up styling; get rid of inline styling and use classes, and be consistent
7. Now that config is gone, allow selecting starting time from a dropdown on the frontend (e.g. 10, 15, 30)
8. Responsive design
9. Abandonment message doesn't work
10. Frontend errors when server is not responsive
11. Acknowledgement packets
12. Allow canceling of find a game requests
