# Must Go Faster

### TODO

1. Menu for piece selection during promotion (not supported by Chessground)
2. Make game over modal presentable
3. Increment?
4. Show material count
5. The clock is wrong; time jumps up after opponent move -- only because of premoves though
6. Clean up styling; get rid of inline styling and use classes, and be consistent
7. Now that config is gone, allow selecting starting time from a dropdown on the frontend (e.g. 10, 15, 30)
